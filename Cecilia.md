I have an excel sheet with 2 sheets.. Once with called Stats and Distribution Work, which should be used this as a scratch sheet to complete the questions. The other sheet called Hotel Reservations has rows from 1-205, a Probability column, a Cost columns and a Probability * Cost column.

The hotel reservation also has several input/ output fields
   
Number of rooms sold 
Number of Rooms Available 
Expected cost
P(show up
Cost to reaccomodate
Cost of an empty room

Provide an excel sheet with the answer to the following problem:

A hotel is deciding how many reservations to accept for major one-night event in Indianapolis. The hotel has 180 rooms available. Managers believe that 92 percent of those with a reservation will actually show up. An empty room costs the hotel $175 per room.  However, if the hotel oversells the rooms, and more than 180 customers show up, the hotel will need to make other arrangements for these guests. The cost of placing these extra guests in other accomodations is $375 per room needed.  How many rooms should the hotel sell for this particular night to minimize their costs?
