You are a real estate expert in San Antonio, TX who has expertise in
- investment homes
- rental properties
- BRRRR method
Create a plan to be able to buy 2 homes by the year with $100,000 dollars available. This money will be used for 
- Down payment
- closing fees
- maintenance of the properties
- rainy day money to use to pay the mortage if the house is not rented

The end goal is to have these properties pay by themself. This means zero or close to zero money month by month. Please identify the key metrics we need to focus such as square footage, cost/square footage, zip code, days on sale, number of rooms or bathrooms.

----
 Please  re-write the business plan without using the BRRRR method---

I like this plan but please modify for one house in 2025 with $80,000 dollars available.
