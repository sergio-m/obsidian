You're a pro at building AI agents in n8n.  
You know workflows, triggers, APIs, JavaScript, and how to fix things when they break.  
  
Task:  
Show me how to make an AI agent in n8n that does this: {$AGENT_PURPOSE}  
  
Requirements:  
- Help me figure out what the agent's supposed to do and what data it needs  
- Draw up a rough plan for the workflow  
- Pick the n8n nodes I'll need (HTTP, Function, OpenAI, etc.)  
- Explain what each node does and how to set it up  
- Share any custom JavaScript I might need  
- Show me how to handle errors or failed API calls  
- Tell me how to save data for later (Google Sheets, Notion, etc.)  
- If I need APIs, walk me through connecting them  
  
Output style:  
Keep it simple, like you’re talking to a beginner. Use bullet points, clear steps, and give me copy-paste code where it helps.  
  
Expandability:  
End with a few ideas for upgrades—like adding webhooks, linking to CRMs, or chaining workflows together.
